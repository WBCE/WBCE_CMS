# WebsiteBaker Community Edition (WBCE)
The [WebsiteBaker Community Edition](http://wbce.org) (`WBCE` or `WebsiteBaker CE`) is the further development of the classic content management system (CMS) [WebsiteBaker](http://websitebaker.org), based on [WebsiteBaker 2.8.3-SP4](http://wiki.websitebaker.org/wbdownload/SP4ForWb2-8-3.zip). 

Experienced developers, designers und users will work together to give `WebsiteBaker` a future - without personal struggles, without hopeless outdated modules and without templates from internet stone age. [WBCE](http://wbce.org) aims to show that `WebsiteBaker` is not yet dead - and there's a community, where the idea of reaching a common goal is more important than sandbox quarrels. Welcome to [WBCE](http://wbce.org)!

## Features
`WebsiteBaker Community Edition` is a content management system which aims to combine security, a user friedly interface, search engine optimization and performance in the best way. As a further development of the approved, but a bit aged `WebsiteBaker` CMS, `WBCE` has broke free from burdens, but is as compatible as possible to all modules which are at least a little bit maintained.

Furthermore `WBCE` is shipped with the most useful modules and modifications for `WebsiteBaker` recently developed by the community. So you have the full power of a tweaked `WebsiteBaker` without patching core files and installing modules by yourself. `WBCE` shows what WebsiteBaker could be. 

## Requirements
  - about 10 MB webspace
  - PHP 5.3.6 or newer
