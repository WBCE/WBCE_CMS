     I did not remove WB Classic compatibility.

     https://forum.wbce.org/viewtopic.php?pid=8295#p8295

     The code used mysql_real_escape_string() that will fail inf the server has no
     mysql module installed.

     Many servers only support mysqli and PDO.

     Another issue is that WBCE has an autoloader so all core classes are available
     as soon as you required config.php. If you try to require class admin that is
     already loaded at this point the code may fail because of double declaration.
     So please use require _once.

   > Direct output pipe for all situations
     I extended class wb to offer a direct output pipe for modules/templates

     and JSON replies.

     If you call

     $admin->DirectOutput("ANTON AUS TIROL");
     or in frontend
     $wb->DirectOutput("ANTON AUS TIROL");

     It will output only "ANTON AUS TIROL" and  stopp script execution immediately.

     If you just set

     $admin->sDirectOutput="";
     or in frontend
     $wb->sDirectOutput="";

     It will runn through full Page generation but still "ANTON AUS TIROL"
     Will be the only answer given back as page.

     Replace ANTON AUS TIROL  whith you favourite JSON or XLM answer.

   > Added WbSearchBox class
     I was extremely tired of the complicated ways i had to use to display loginboxes and seachboxes
         in WBCE templates. there where a few snippets for this but they where not templateable at all,
         depended on TWIG , did not match all my needs....

         So here we got a new Searchbox whith enough Divs to get a decent styling, an option to override
         the whole design in your Template , options to override almost everything and you may fetch the
         result instead of echo it immediately.

         The Basic call usually looks like this:
         ````
             WbSearchBox::Show();
         ````
         You may supply an options array to this Static method.
         ````
             WbSearchBox::Show(array(
                 "sHeadline"   => "Search here:",
                 "sSendText"   => "GO"
                 "sFormMethod" => "post"
             ));
         ````
         Or you may use the OOP variant:
         ````
             $SB= new WbSearchBox()
             $SB->sHeadline    = "Search here:",
             $SB->sSendText    =  "GO"
             $SB->sFormMethod  = "post"
             $SB->Display();
         ````
         The Display Method allows for returning the value instead of echo it directly
         ````
             $sMySearchBoxHtml=$SB->Display(false);
         ````
         In addition it is possible to hand an options array directly to the constructor
         ````
             $aOptions= array(
                 "sHeadline"   => "Search here:",
                 "sSendText"   => "GO"
                 "sFormMethod" => "post"
             ));

             $SB= new WbSearchBox($aOptions)
             $SB->Display();
         ````

         __Templates__

         The Template for this Class is stored in: @n
             /templates/systemplates/searchbox.tpl.php

         To override it whith your own create the folder /systemplates/ in your template folder and copy the file
         "searchbox.tpl.php" from the default folder to your folder. Change the file to match your needs.
         The class will override the system file automatic.

     // $block[100]     = 'Hidden2'; // if you need multiple hidden blocks , please continue counting from 99 up

     ````
     You now can call :

     `````
     show_menu2("Main");
     show_menu2("Top");

     <?php page_content("Left");
     <?php page_content("Main");

   > Droplets in Backend
     From Now on its possible to use Droplets in then BE pages .
     Instead of [[yourdroplet]] you have to use [[[yourdroplet]]]
     As filtering for [[yourdroplet]] in the backend would replace all
     droplets in WYSIWYG fields for example.

     In addition the extra <p> tags created by many Editors are filtered out.
     <p>[[yourdroplet]]</p> will become

     [[yourdroplet]] again.

     Not sure if thats a goob idea but we will see.
     This is only done in FE display.

     Right now all droplets can be used as BE Droplets, but i guess not many
     reallly make sense.

   > Added jquery migrate to frontend functions
     The default now should support most browsers and most jquery plugins.
     At least this is the most compatible solution right now.
     Jquery 1.12.0 and migrate 1.3.0.

     In frontend we use migrate-min, if you need Console messages , please
     use the not minimized version.

     NExt Jquery upgrade will be done when Jquery 3 is really really stable and
     most modules are at least Jquery 2 Compatible.

     1.12 got same api but wider browser support, at least thats the

     turned on .

   > ckeditor 4.5.5 loading css three times
     From :
     https://github.com/qssocial/WebsiteBaker_CommunityEdition/commit/ddb56403b57877653b245ede47d4c5f3096d3278

     1. Ckeditor loading tree times css !.
     2. CKEditor uses the functions "LoadOnFly" (we do not have it) for
     loading css.

     Therefore, "backend.css" not worked properly.
     I added to ckeditor.php in "private function init ()" loading of
     "backend.css" and removed ln 360
     " // $ this-> loadBackendCss ();"
     Please see if it works correctly.

     This was needed for Webadmin tool and maybe is needed for other tools too.

     - FTAN implemented
     - Cleaned up folder Structure
     - Uses "no_page" now.
     - Added return to admin tools button.
     - No more risk that an attacker attacks the backup-sql.php

     I had the problem that i was working on a admin tool that was offering a
     file for download. the problem was that calling new admin() produced some
     headers and output cause of silly PHPlib.

     Now we have an additional post variable "no_page" to suppress all admin
     output.  Simply add:

     <input type="hidden" name="no_page" value="no_page" />

     To the template and you are done.

     - You now can switch ALL Filter on and of, even droplets and insert.
     - Fixed css to head as the old version only functioned whith XHTML,
       not html4 neither html5. And to be true it wasn't really functional
       at all.
     - Removed the bullshit Ftan_Supported File.(even though ftan is supported)
     - Removed useless/halfbaken filter API File.
     - Tool now runns whith Settings Class so no extra DB Table is needed.
     - All filter can be turned off completely.(for interaction whith OPF Dashboard)
     - Short URL is now a filter routine , so there no longer is a need for a
       droplet in the template.
     - Removed that odd mailfilter mojo which used binary filter to set options
       but only had 3 options.
     - Some smaller tweaks on several filter.
     - Some general cleanup.
     - filter_functions-php  is the main filter file again, and index.php is
       changed to use it.

     For me its fist time the old WB filter feel usefull and functional at least
     to some extend, and more importand you can deactivate what you don't need.

     Todo:
     - Fetch old DB settings on upgrade, remove old Table.

   > Extend loading of module files (initialize.php, preinit.php)
     Greatly extendes the Loading mechanism for modules.

     /framework/initialize.php  now loads the file initialize.php and preinit.php
     if the module info contains "initialize" or "preinit"in $module_function.

     Preinit is hooked into initialize process very early, where only the database
     is loaded and nothing else. You even can set important System constants here or
     redefine the Page id. This is needed so things like the multidomain patch can
     be implemented as a module.

     Initialize is hooked near the end of the initialize process where most global
     stuff is already set. Autoloader is available , Settings are available, Path
     and other constants is set. This is a good place where you can register classes
     that schould be able to run in FE and BE. Library modules can be made this way.,
     just register your classes here for the autoloader. Classes in include.php only
     are avaialble in frontend right now.

     Including include.php has changed too in frontend functions. It now allows for
     loading snippets from any modul that got "snippet" in $module_function.
     This,  together whith initialize and preinit now allows a lot of combinations
     in modules. News can bring their own anynews, slider can bring a nice snipit
     with admintool combination, library modules are possible, multidomain as a module,
     ... and many more options.

     This still needs some addons to be fully functional, but those changes come up soon.

     Problem is in mediacenter, because the mediasettings only exist, when at least one time the mediaoptions are stored. So storing the options will end up this notice until an new folder is created.
     One idea for solving this would be to check if mediasettings for a folder do exist:

     Both files allow the Module author to hook into the initialize process of WB(CE)
     pre_init.php hooks into initialize before anything else than the database
     initialization is done Yo can change System Constants like WB_PATH or change languages
     post parameters or maybe the domain or page_id.  That way even the multifomain patch may
     become a maintainable(via admin tool) modul.

     initialize.php is loaded after autoloader is activated , system constants are set, and
     session is activated. You now can login users, change Languages , still change the page_id
     and maybe register some additional system classes as the autoloader is already active.

     This is available vor ALL Modules and as a special feature it is available in the backend.
     So its possible to register classes for backend use here.

     Have Fun

     This way an admintool is allowed to bring its own frontend functions.
     Page modules can offer additional functions pagewide.

     Examples:
     Ruuds Slider that is maintained via an admin tool. Before this you
     had to install the admin tool and the snipit seperately, or do some
     ugly tricks.  Now you can use combinations like this whithout any extra trouble.
     (admin tool whith include.php)

     News module whith integrated functions like anynews that are available on any page.
     (page module whith additional include.php)

     Or maybe an Editor that comes whith functions for usieng it in frontend Forms.
     (wysiwyg whith include.php))

     The same works for gallerys too.

     Simply add an include.php to your module, if your module is installed and the file is there , its loaded.
     Although nice to register classes for the autoloader. That way you easyly create a library module.

     Hope Module authors have fun whith this.

   > Activated autoloader + Some cleanup in Initialize.
     Autoloader is now activated and available .
     And i did some cleanup to initialize.php
     Still there is lots of work to do.

     The autoloader now loads most WB libraries on autopilot.
     /framework/ folder is searched and some includes are Set right now.
     Twig and PHP mailer load their own autoloader.

     To register a new directory:
     WbAuto::AddDir("/classes/somewhere/");

     Register a special file (very fast plus you can load non standard conform stuff):
     WbAuto::AddFile("MultiCrud","/classes/multicrud.php");

     Register a new search shemata:
     WbAuto::AddType("class.%s.inc.php");

     Register Vars are global and can be printed for debug:
     echo  "<pre>"; print_r(WbAuto::$Dirs); echo  "</pre>";
     echo  "<pre>"; print_r(WbAuto::$Files); echo  "</pre>";
     echo  "<pre>"; print_r(WbAuto::$Types); echo  "</pre>";

     So if you would like to offer a library module you simply can do :
     <?php WbAuto::AddDir("/mysnippit/classes/");
     in the include.php et voila you got a library module.

   > Loading of admin tools now changed a lot
     - Check for ftan file is removed. checkfile removed too. Admin tools
       whithout ftan will function again.

     - Added functionality for bach to admin tools, simply set value="admin_tools"
       to the button. If $_POST['admin_tools'] this will redirect to admin tools.

     - Several additional vars for path and other purpose:
       $modulePath     Path to this module directory
       $languagePath   Path to language files of this module
       $returnToTools  Url to return to generic tools page
       $returnUrl      Url for return link after saving AND for sending the form!
       $doSave         Set true if form is send
       $toolDir        Plain tool directory name like "maintainance_mode"
       $toolName       The name of the tool eg "Maintainance Mode"

       For automated detection of sent form the submit button needs to have
       name+id ="save_settings". (Optional ($_POST['action']) == 'save')

     - The following WB classes and Modules are included automatic so no need
       to try manual loading:

       config.php
       framework/initialize.php
       framework/class.wb.php
       framework/class.admin.php
       framework/functions.php

     - some really old admin tools try to load backend.css and backend.js manually,
       please remove this code as we no longer need to suppot  WB 2.6.x.

     - Flattened out the structure to have a more linear workflow.

     - Language files are noaded here(if they exist) and we use new way of
       loading so even if language file is incomplete in its translation
       it will simply display englisch text instead of an error.

   > Installation of new settings class
     As i tried to make a admin tool  for setting of maintainance mode, i realized
     that there is nothing for easy management of WBs system settings.
     You still have to do it manually.  But i remembered that some module where
     using some set_settings() get_settings() functions(e.g. jsadmin).
     So i did a deep thought an decided that it would be a good idea that the
     whole settings management would be a lot more fun it we got some dedicated
     functions to handle this.
     If we use constants we schould do it in a good and clean way, so i put a
     few lines together and would like to know if you got some more ideas
     i can put into this.

     // create or edit a setting
     Settings::Set("wb_new_setting","the value");

     // using a setting
     if (WB_NEW_SETTING =="the value") echo "Horay";

     // there is a get function but this is mostly used internal
     $myValue= Settings::Get ("wb_new_setting");

     // deleting
     Settings::Delete("wb_new_setting");

     // if used in modules please prepend (shortened)module name to avoid collisions
     Settings::Set("wysi_new_setting","another value");

     Please keep in mind that WB stores settings always as strings.

   > Adding a maintainance mode
     The Maintainance mode is activated by setting a constant in the config.php.

     define('WB_MAINTAINANCE_MODE', true);

     You can deactivate it by either deleting the line or by setting the mode
     to false.

     The default template for maintainance mode can be found in
     /templates/system/maintainance.tpl.php

     Any template can have a custom maintainance template placed in
     /templates/yourtemplate/system/maintainance.tpl.php

     At this time the maintainance mode is limited to use the default template
     set in website options in the backend.

     As a next step there will be an admintool that allows to set the mode from
     the backend.

   > Webadmin Filemnager
     Download from: https://gist.github.com/nic-o/1219610 as the original
     page (http://cker.name/webadmin/)had a disfunctional .zip file

     I added this opensource filemanager to remove files from the webspace
     that have been added by websitebaker whith invalid file and directory
     permissions on a Server that uses PHP as Apache module.

     On such a server it may happen that if you try to remove such files via
     FTP you may get a "insufficient permissions error". Thats because the
     files are created by the webserver under a user different from FTP user.

     Just copy this filemanager into the webroot of your page and call:

     www.yourdomain.com/webadmin.php

     !!! ATTENTION !!!
     Please keep in mind that this admintool also can be abused as a hacking
     tool (indeed its a pretty good one, almost a hackershell)
     So please remove it after use or install it into a password protected
     directory (Its not necessary to install it into webroot).
     Please be really carefull!

   > Changed language file loading mechanism
     Now we load the default file (EN) and then we load the
     local(userdefined) file. That way even an incomplete Language file at
     least displays the english text instead of an error message.

     Loading of compatibility file now moved to initialize instead of
     doing it in each separated language file.

   > Fixed IDKEY in Secureform
     I still had problems whith Security warnings on pages that used alot of
     IDKEYS. For example if i tried to move a field in the basic form module
     i had one  Warning on in about 15 atempts.

     Another Problem: unused old IDKEYS where never deleted so session got
     spammed by idkeys.

     So i made a more unique ID, recursive checking for overlapping ids,
     added a tiemout for IDKEYS (same as for FTAN) and added a page parameter
     to instantly delete all keys from a pagecall if one is used.

     Last thing i added is an additional parameter that allows the use of
     IDKEYS whith ajax scripts. If this setting is used, the key is not
     removed and can be used multiple times. (this is a small security risk
     but nothing compared to the 1 in 16 chance to guess the key that we had
     before. )

     This is a patch from my old fork only tested on my local installation.

     relies un the "user search"  module , which is added too.
