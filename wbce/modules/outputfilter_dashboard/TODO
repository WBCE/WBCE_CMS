TODO list for future releases
=============================

- Would be good to include some more example filters

- Rework the layout to mirror WBCE theming and make this tool easier to grasp.

- Switch DB queries from PracticalModuleFunctions to WBCE Database class ones as
  some of Thorn's (original author) were already implemented in the WBCE Database class.

- Improve documentation


DONE already
============================
- change template engine from phplib to pure php (or Twig maybe?)
