TODO list for future releases
=============================
- review if the default values of the settings (e.g. auto place holders switched off are ok to go)
- when shipped as core-module, block uninstall of the dashboard

- maybe include more example filters one time
- change template engine from phplib to pure php (or Twig maybe?)
