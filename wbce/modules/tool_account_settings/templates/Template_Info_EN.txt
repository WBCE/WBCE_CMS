THIS IS THE FOLDER WITH ALL THE TEMPLATES USED ALONG WITH THE 
ACCOUNT AND SIGN-UP FUNCTIONALITY IN THE FRONTEND OF WBCE CMS

PLEASE NOTE: It's not recommended to edit those files directly!
             If you do so, all your changes will be overwritten with the next system upgrade of your installation.


If you want to change the layouts of this templates, it is RECOMMENDED to follow these steps:

1) Go to the template directory of your active template 
   (it's the one that is selected in the settings of your WBCE installation).

2) create a directory with the name 'overrides', 
   move into this directory and create another directory with the name 'account',
   lastly, create yet another directory within it named 'templates'
   The structure of your template directory now should look like this:


    [DEFAULT_TEMPLATE]
        └─ overrides
            └─ account
                └─ templates


3) Copy the files of folder [root]/modules/tool_account_settings/templates
   and paste them into the [YOUR TEMPLATE DIR]/overrides/account direcory
   The structure of your template directory now should look like this:   


    [DEFAULT_TEMPLATE]
        └─ overrides
            └─ account
                └─ templates
                    ├─ form_forgot_login_details.twig
                    ├─ form_login.twig
                    ├─ form_preferences.twig
                    ├─ form_signup.twig
                    ├─ msg_activation_link_sent.twig
                    ├─ msg_forgot_login_details_sent.twig
                    ├─ msg_login_details_just_sent.twig
                    ├─ msg_manager_approval_feedback.twig
                    ├─ msg_manager_confirm_new_signup.twig
                    ├─ msg_wrong_inputs.twig
                    └─ forms.css


4) You can now change the layout of these files and the system will use these files instead of the ones
   present in the [root]/modules/tool_account_settings/templates directory
   and you prevent your layout changes from being overwritten with the next system upgrade. 

PLEASE ALSO NOTE:
   If you only want to change the layout of one of the template files, say for example the form_login.twig
   you would copy and paste only this file into the [YOUR TEMPLATE DIR]/overrides/account directory.
