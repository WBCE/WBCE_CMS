MarkdownReader for WBCE CMS
===========================

TODO:

~ improve wbce-day and wbce-night source highlighter theme css to get closer to 
    the themes we use with CodeMirror
~ write a README.md with instructions how to use
~ there is a need to create a popup window trigger (like the one we are currently
    using with Outputfilter Dashboard to cause the md file to read there.
~ Check if there is a need and if yes, create a separate reader that produces 
    no <html> and no <body> to use within modules instead of a popup window 
    (may be needed but I am not sure about that yet -- check and decide).
