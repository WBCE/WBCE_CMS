EditArea has been designated as DEPRECATED 
for use with WBCE and any of its modules.

EditArea hasn't been maintained in years and is causing problems with newer
browsers.
Therefore the Dev Team of WBCE decided to move away from EditArea and switch 
to CodeMirror, a syntax highlighter and code editor that is still actively
developed and very well documented.

It's highly discouraged to use this WBCE EditArea implementation in modules
and it will be removed completely from the /include/ folder in one of the
upcoming WBCE releases.

For CodeMirror implementation look into the code of
/modules/CodeMirror_Config/initialize.php
